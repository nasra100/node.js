Here's a README template based on the code you provided. I've included a detailed explanation of the project, how to run it, and the specific function's working, along with an example of usage.

Project: Calculate Monthly Targets Excluding Fridays
Description
This project calculates the monthly targets for a specified time period, excluding Fridays, based on a total annual target. The primary function, calculateTotalTarget, computes how many days (excluding Fridays) are in each month within the specified time period, how many working days have passed, and then distributes the total annual target proportionally based on the number of days worked.

How It Works
The function calculateTotalTarget takes three parameters:

startDate (e.g., '2024-01-01'): The start of the period you want to calculate for.
endDate (e.g., '2024-03-30'): The end of the period.
totalAnnualTarget (e.g., 5220): The total target for the year.
The function performs the following steps:

Iterates through each month in the specified period.
For each day in the month, it checks if the day is a Friday. If it's not a Friday, it's counted as a working day.
The function tracks the total number of working days, excluding Fridays, for each month.
It calculates a daily target based on the total annual target and distributes this daily target across the months based on the number of working days in each month.
It returns an object containing:
daysExcludingFridays: The total number of working days in each month.
daysWorkedExcludingFridays: The number of working days between the start and end date for each month.
monthlyTargets: The target for each month based on the working days.
totalTarget: The total calculated target for the specified period.

Running the Code
Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:

N
node index.js
You can modify the parameters in the example usage of calculateTotalTarget to calculate targets for different periods and target amounts.

Example Usage
Here’s an example to calculate the monthly targets for the period from January 1, 2024, to March 30, 2024, with an annual target of 5220:

javascript
Copy code
const result = calculateTotalTarget('2024-01-01', '2024-03-30', 5220);
console.log(result);
Example Output
The result might look like this:

json
Copy code
{
  "daysExcludingFridays": [23, 21, 21],
  "daysWorkedExcludingFridays": [23, 21, 21],
  "monthlyTargets": [1203.33, 1098.57, 1098.57],
  "totalTarget": 3398.47
}
Explanation:

daysExcludingFridays: Total number of working days (excluding Fridays) for each month.
daysWorkedExcludingFridays: Working days that fall between the start and end dates for each month.
monthlyTargets: The calculated target for each month based on the days worked.
totalTarget: The total target for the entire period from January 1 to March 30, 2024.
Assumptions and Limitations
The function assumes that the total annual target is equally distributed across all working days in the year (excluding Fridays).
It calculates based on the Gregorian calendar, and public holidays or other non-working days besides Fridays are not considered in this implementation.
The target is distributed evenly, without factoring in any special monthly adjustments.
